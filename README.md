# TDPanalysis: Functions to process Granier's Sap Flow Sensors (TDP) data

Set of functions designed to help in the analysis of TDP sensors. Features includes dates and time conversion, weather data interpolation, daily maximum of tension analysis and calculations required to convert sap flow density data to sap flow rates at the tree and plot scale (For more information see : Granier (1985) <doi:10.1051/forest:19850204> & Granier (1987) <doi:10.1093/treephys/3.4.309>).
